Todo Questions:
 - default label/input association?
 - which input tags need to be/should be closed?
 - i forgot, but script tags need to be closed
 - why does everything use a factory function instead of new?
 - why/when is ember-data required?
 - how to dynamically set properties on load? (place holder for ex.)
 - What is the difference between what's on the model and the controller as defaults?
 - why are some props on handlebars stuff strings and others not? is it because of how they are compiled?
 - why do some controller methods take params?
 - why do controller methods seem to get called twice? (ex. removeTodo)?
 - is the todosIndexRoute unnecessary after the IndexRoute is declared?
 - why do subroutes use this?
